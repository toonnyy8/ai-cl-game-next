# Hisagi Shūhei (檜佐木修兵) — design (in progress)

The next SOUL DUEL fighter after Lille (the user, 2026-10-16). Status: concept stage, no code. Process: skill
`duel-character` (intent questions → canon research → design doc + adversarial review → batch 1 playable → playtest loop).
Canon research: `docs/research/hisagi/notes.md` (graded A–D).

## 1. The choice (the user, 2026-10-16)

- Asked which fighter comes next, the lead proposed Kyōraku / Yhwach / Byakuya. The user asked for plans for four others
  (「經歷最後的月牙天衝修行後的一護、破面篇與崩玉逐漸融合的藍染、能虛化與歸刃的東仙要、學會卍解的檜佐木」) and for Mayuri
  (「涅繭利呢？」); the lead's sketches are in DEVLOG §230. Ranked by build risk, Hisagi came first (lowest: reuses the
  chain idea, no HUD / lock-on changes), paired with Tōsen next (canon: his captain, whom he killed).
- The user: 「先從檜佐木開始設計」.
- Forms: base = Shikai Kazeshini (風死, two sickles joined by a long chain), awakening = Bankai 風死絞縄 (canon from the
  light novel *Can't Fear Your Own World*; the user's acceptance of a novel-only source is implied by the request).
- Roster: a new index (7) appended by load order; slot 5 stays reserved (AGENTS.md).

## 2. Intent decisions (AskUserQuestion, 2026-10-16)

| # | Question | The user's pick | Rejected |
|---|---|---|---|
| H1 | Caught inside 2 m? | **Shorten the chain and spin-cut at close range** (an all-rounder, a little weaker up close) | the chain pulls him / flings the opponent back out to mid range (a pure mid-range fighter); close range as his plain weakness |
| H2 | A "blade not in hand" state after a throw? | **Yes: no second throw until the sickle comes back** (auto or pulled back by a press; he is weaker while it is out: 「害怕自己的刀」, the retrieve timing is his skill) | the throw returns at once (a plain mid-range move) |
| H3 | The Bankai's direction | **Wait for the canon research**, then 2–3 proposals to pick from | a tether with K.O. suspended and the damage settled as a debt when it breaks (the lead's recommendation); a tether only (a range cap, normal damage) |

## 3. Open

- H3 after the research; then the move set as a segment table (`duel-move-modules`), the movement units, tap / hold and
  the touch mapping, the motion style (`duel-motion-style`).
